Documenting my Golang journey

## Why Go?

- compiled to single to a single binary file, it could be 200x faster than most interpreted Languages.
- No runtime to worry about
- statically typed, so no surprises at run time.
- Object oriented (sort of) [interfaces]
- Concurrency model that facilites a fast and rapid development
- Cross platform
- Excellent package management & testing built in
- East to learn (xD)
